//Tore down original concept
//Started over with just the five buttons, filter still works so that function is right.
// Changed everything from clortho to Hogwarts for simplicities sake and offensive content hidden in video
// Prioritizing functionality over styling until it works the way it should.
//Planning was much simpler and easier to understand on the white board, not a fan of dbdiagram.
//Will readjust issue ticket to match current problems.
//Fixed div sizing in css to help visualize better.
//Can't get sort form to work and now my original cards don't show up, i am going to try using some different code to see if that works, then delete and rewrite my own way.
//RANDOMIZER IS WORKING!!! We have reached MVP i believe.
//For loop used for filter and cards
//Made significant breakthrough with moving students to the other div using another for loop.
//Now with MVP achieved, we can move on to loom and preparing the presentation.
